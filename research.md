### [Do financial incentives affect care provision in Medicaid? Evidence from Florida Medicaid’s Payment Reform](http://jxx87.github.io/research/Florida.pdf)

*Abstract* While there is a large body of literature examining how physicians respond to 
financial incentives in the context of Medicare and private payers, evidence on this issue for
Medicaid is scant. Since Medicaid patients typically constitute only a small fraction
of a physician’s patients, evidence in other settings may not apply to Medicaid. On
this front, I study how care provision responds to Florida Medicaid’s 2017 payment
reform, which transitions from a fee-for-service to a prospective payment system for
outpatient services. This transition creates procedure-specific payment shocks. Using
procedure-level policy exposure measures, I find evidence that physicians reduce the
use of procedures that are expected ex ante to be more likely to receive no payment
under the new system. Additionally, the effects are concentrated on patients without
co-morbidities and are observed only in facilities that are more dependent on
Medicaid revenues. These findings imply that physicians do respond to financial incentives
for Medicaid services. Thus, similar reforms hold out the promise to improve
cost-efficiency in health care for Medicaid patients.
