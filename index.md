**Greetings, and welcome to my webpage!** I am a Ph.D. candidate at Tulane University. My research fields include health economics and applied microeconomics in general. I am interested in applying state-of-the-art data analysis techniques (e.g., econometrics, machine/deep learning) to health-related behavior and policy issues. I am passionate about developing and contributing my skills to improve people's health outcomes and quality of life.

Prior to Tulane, I earned my M.S. in Economics at Drexel University as well as my M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. Before graduate school, I earned my B.S. in Applied Physics at Beijing Jiaotong University in China.
